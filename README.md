# Hello!

Welcome to my webpage repository. I have only began to become acquainted with HTML and basic GitHub formalities so I sincerely apologize for the uglyness of this README file. I look forward to building my webpage into a more professional, well developed page. I also look forward to becoming more comfortable with GitHub and all of the quirks.
